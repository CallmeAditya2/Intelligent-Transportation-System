# Intelligent-Transportation-System
A Software application developed using SVM machine learning model that predicts traffic conditions in a given area,leveraging historical traffic data and other relevant variables.
The demand for efficient and intelligent transportation systems has increased with the growing population and urbanization. An intelligent transportation system applies innovative and advanced techniques to provide intelligent services to different modes of transport, making the transportation system more effective. These techniques provide traffic information to users in advance, improving the coordination and safety of the transport network. Accurate prediction of traffic flow is crucial for making decisions such as route guidance, mode of transport, and travel time. Congestion management, incident detection, and individual dynamic route guidance all require accurate prediction of traffic flow on the given road network.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is widely used for classification and regression problems. It is grounded in statistical learning theory and can be used to define a function that predicts features of future data. Traffic flow prediction is a non-linear problem that can be addressed using support vector regression (SVR). However, it requires mapping the traffic flow prediction problem from a low-dimensional space to a high-dimensional feature space. Traffic flow is a time-varying quantity and exhibits non-linear and random characteristics.
In conclusion, an intelligent transportation system that can accurately predict traffic flow is essential for efficient and safe transport networks. SVM and SVR are effective tools for traffic flow prediction, which can aid in congestion management, incident detection, and individual dynamic route guidance. These techniques are grounded in statistical learning theory and require mapping from low-dimensional spaces to high-dimensional feature spaces to address non-linear and time-varying traffic flow characteristics.
